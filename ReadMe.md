> I see myself working as a Full-Stack Developer and making tons of applications and websites along the way. Even though I already graduated from school I still see myself studying really hard both programming and designing as I find learning quite enjoyable. Lastly, I want to create my own tech related business that focuses on development and helping small/start-up companies to be successful.

- **Interests:** traveling, programming, designing, and developing applications and websites
- **Hobbies:** reading manhwa, manga, non-fiction, and, fiction books, watching TV shows and series, learning/studying, and sleeping
